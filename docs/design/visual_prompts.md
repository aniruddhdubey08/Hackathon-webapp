## 1. Home / Landing Page
**Prompt:**
> Desktop website landing page 16:9. Cyberpunk command center style. "DOMINATE THE INTELLECTUAL FRONTIER" headline in glitchy white monospace font. Background is deep void black with faint grid lines. A large glowing "INITIALIZE UPLINK" button in Neon Cyan #06b6d4. A 3D hologram of a human brain or network node floats on the right. Tech markers and data readouts in corners. Sleek, mysterious, high-tech.

## 2. Login Page
**Prompt:**
> Futuristic security login screen. Dark background with floating dust particles. Center screen is a glass panel with "IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED" text. Two input fields look like command line prompts with Cyan blinking cursors. A "Scan Biometrics" button below. The UI feels like accessing a secret government server. Sharp edges, glowing borders.

## 3. Student Dashboard
**Prompt:**
> Sci-fi tactical dashboard UI. Top HUD bar shows rank "CADET" and rapidly changing data numbers. Main content is a "Mission Control" panel. Modules for Physics, Math, and History look like data files or weapon loadouts. Progress bars are thin laser lines in Cyan. A mini-map in the corner shows a network graph. Dark slate colors, blue glow effects.

## 4. Subject Level Map
**Prompt:**
> Full screen network graph interface. Deep space background with distant stars. The "Level Map" is a constellation of connected nodes. Active nodes pulse with electric blue light. Completed nodes are green hexagons. The path between them is a data stream. Creating a sense of navigating a star map or neural network.

## 5. Learning Page
**Prompt:**
> Data uplink interface. The main content is a text readout on a high-transparency black glass pane. "DOWNLOAD IN PROGRESS" bar at the top. Holographic schematic diagrams (e.g., a suspension bridge force vector) project from the screen. Monospace typography. "ACKNOWLEDGE" button at the bottom. The user feels like they are downloading knowledge directly into their brain.

## 6. Quiz Page
**Prompt:**
> Tactical combat simulation UI. Top center shows a red "Enemy Integrity" bar. The Question is displayed as an "Incoming Transmission". Four answer buttons are styled as chamfered tactical keys. When selected, they glow Neon Purple. "TARGET LOCKED" feedback text. High contrast, intense atmosphere.

## 7. Battle Lobby
**Prompt:**
> Multiplayer matchmaking screen. Dark mode. A large rotating radar sweep animation in the center. Green "Ping" dots appear. Text "SCANNING FREQUENCIES..." blinks in orange. User stats shown in a holographic side panel. The visual language of a fighter jet HUD or submarine sonar.

## 8. Battle Page
**Prompt:**
> Split screen cyber warfare interface. Left side is Blue (You), Right side is Purple (Enemy). A "Power Balance" bar at the top shows energy pushing back and forth. Both sides display code snippets and quiz questions. Sparks fly where the colors meet. "SYSTEM WARNING" red alerts flash on the losing side. Fast-paced, chaotic, arcade action.

## 9. Result Page
**Prompt:**
> Mission Debrief screen. "MISSION SUCCESS" stamped in glowing green stencil font. Background is a victory freeze-frame. Results are shown as a "Data Log" receipt. An XP bar fills up with liquid neon animation. "RE-DEPLOY" button is the primary focus. Industrial, military-grade aesthetic.

## 10. Leaderboard
**Prompt:**
> Global surveillance list. A data table showing "Top Operatives". The list looks like a hacking terminal or FBI wanted list. Avatars have a digital glitch filter. The user's row is highlighted with a bright Cyan scanline. Columns for "Rank", "Operative", and "Intel".
